### first date alpha version

[title](screens/title.png)

## first impressions can be tricky

first date is a game based on what can be considered socially acceptable behavior.  users are expected to make the correct choices in the hopes of forming a bond with their date. certain reactions and responses will displease the person who decided to spend their time with the user.

## motivations

i wanted to create a game to show what i have learned so far in class and also challenge me to employ new techniques. though i had some reservations about the concept at first, i enjoy the game's use of common sense social mor√©s as game logic because i feel it will make it all the more appealing once it is in pristine working order.

## unsolved problems

i am still ironing out some glitches in the game play. some responses are still acting unusual during game play. wins and losses are still possible but needs refinement. pictures still need some optimization and animation. i am going to incorporate more gifs rather than still pngs in the coming days/weeks to bring the game play further to life. sounds are also in the process of being applied to the game play.  i may have underestimated just how much i would end up wanting to put into the game and subsequently prioritzed certain aspects while ignoring others due to time constraints and communication with my art collaborator.

## success

despite the aforementioned problems, my classmates seemed pleased and interested when using the game. it is playable to the end with wins and losses within the realm of possibility. while i can't quite say that i am happy with it yet, i am proud of my progress.
